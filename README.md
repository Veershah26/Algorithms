# Algorithms
I started this project when I was in the 2nd year of my University, this was supposed to be a repository of algorithms, inspired by the OG algorithms repo, I will recreate all the algorithms in the original repo, but in my flavor, eventually turning this into my own pet project to help others learn algorithms.
