**Version:** 1.2  
**Date:** April 11, 2025  
**Prepared For:** LLM Engineering Teams & Stakeholders

## Abstract:

The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates focused efforts to extend their capabilities beyond high-resource languages. Gujarati, a significant regional language, presents an opportunity for targeted LLM enhancement to improve accessibility and application scope. This white paper details a comprehensive research and implementation plan for fine-tuning Google's Gemma 3 4B model, a powerful open-source multimodal LLM, to achieve superior proficiency in Gujarati language understanding, conversation, and summarization. We outline the model's suitability, survey relevant datasets, propose preprocessing strategies, define a concrete task mix and training methodology using Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT), detail tokenizer validation, establish evaluation metrics and an explicit benchmarking plan, estimate potential costs and training times, outline a deployment strategy, and address potential challenges. The goal is to provide a practical, actionable roadmap for developing and deploying a highly capable Gujarati LLM based on the Gemma 3 4B architecture.

## 1. Introduction

The demand for sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) in diverse global languages is accelerating. While models trained predominantly on English data exhibit remarkable capabilities, their performance often diminishes when applied to lower-resource languages like Gujarati. Bridging this gap is crucial for equitable access to information, improved human-computer interaction, and the development of localized AI applications. Google's Gemma 3 4B model, with its advanced architecture, multimodal capabilities, and inherent multilingual support, offers a promising foundation for developing specialized language proficiency. This document presents a structured plan to fine-tune Gemma 3 4B specifically for the Gujarati language, aiming to significantly enhance its performance across core NLP tasks: general understanding, conversational interaction, and text summarization.

## 2. Problem Statement

Despite advancements in LLMs, high-performance models tailored for the specific linguistic nuances of Gujarati remain relatively scarce. Standard multilingual models may possess foundational knowledge but often lack the deep understanding required for complex tasks, accurate contextual interpretation, and fluent generation in Gujarati. Key challenges include:

- **Linguistic Nuances:** Handling Gujarati's morphological richness, diacritics, and relatively free word order (SOV structure).
- **Data Availability:** While datasets exist, curating sufficient high-quality, diverse data specifically for fine-tuning across different tasks (general, conversational, summarization) requires careful selection and preprocessing.
- **Computational Resources:** Full fine-tuning of large models like Gemma 3 4B is computationally expensive, necessitating efficient adaptation methods.
- **Evaluation:** Establishing robust metrics and benchmarks to accurately assess performance improvements in Gujarati-specific contexts.

## 3. Proposed Solution: Fine-Tuning Gemma 3 4B

We propose leveraging the Google Gemma 3 4B model as the base for developing enhanced Gujarati language capabilities. This model is selected due to its:

- **State-of-the-Art Architecture:** Built on Gemini research, featuring a 128K token context window, Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and multimodal input processing.
- **Multilingual Foundation:** Pre-trained on 4 trillion tokens, including data from over 140 languages, providing a strong starting point.
- **Efficient Tokenizer:** Utilizes a SentencePiece tokenizer (262K vocabulary) designed for multilingual text encoding.
- **Open-Source Availability:** Facilitates research, development, and deployment.

The core strategy involves Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT), specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to adapt the model to Gujarati tasks without retraining all parameters. This approach significantly reduces computational requirements while achieving substantial performance gains.

## 4. Technical Details & Methodology

### 4.1 Model Architecture Overview (Gemma 3 4B)

- **Parameters:** ~4 Billion
- **Input Modality:** Text, Image
- **Output Modality:** Text
- **Context Window:** 128K tokens
- **Attention:** Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), 5:1 local-to-global attention ratio.
- **Tokenizer:** SentencePiece (262K vocab, shared with Gemini 2.0).
- **Key Features:** Function calling, extensive multilingual pre-training.

### 4.2 Gujarati Datasets Survey

A crucial component is the collection and curation of relevant Gujarati datasets:

- **General Text:** IndicCorp (719M tokens), AI4Bharat-IndicNLP Corpus, CC100-Gujarati, LDC-IL Gujarati Raw Text, GNATD (News), guWaC (Web Corpus), L3Cube-IndicNews.
- **Conversational:** FutureBeeAI Gujarati Chat, Shaip Gujarati Datasets (Call Center, General), OpenSLR transcripts, Microsoft Speech Corpus transcripts, ai4bharat/indic-align (Instruction data), DataoceanAI transcripts, Macgence Telecom/Bank transcripts.
- **Summarization:** XLSum Gujarati (BBC), Indian Language News Text Summarization (Kaggle), ILSUM (Headlines), l3cube-pune/gujarati-bart-summary data (ISum), DUC 2004 Gujarati (Cross-lingual), ai4bharat/IndicSentenceSummarization.

### 4.3 Data Preprocessing Strategy

Effective preprocessing is vital for handling Gujarati's unique characteristics:

- **Tokenization:** Utilize the native Gemma 3 4B SentencePiece tokenizer via Hugging Face's AutoTokenizer. (See Section 4.7 for validation strategy).

```python
# Example: Loading the Gemma 3 4B tokenizer
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load the specific tokenizer for the Gemma 3 4B model
# Replace "google/gemma-3-4b-it" with the exact model identifier if different
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/gemma-3-4b-it")

# Example Gujarati text
gujarati_text = "ગુજરાતી ભાષાના સંસ્કરણ માટે આપનું સ્વાગત છે."

# Tokenize the text
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(gujarati_text)
print(f"Original Text: {gujarati_text}")
print(f"Tokens: {tokens}")

# Encode the text (get input IDs)
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(gujarati_text, return_tensors="pt") # pt for PyTorch tensors
print(f"Input IDs: {input_ids}")
```

- **Normalization:** Employ libraries like `indicnlp.normalize.GujaratiNormalizer` to standardize script variations, handle nuktas, and normalize poorna virama.
- **Diacritics:** Ensure correct preservation and processing during normalization and tokenization.
- **Morphology:** Rely on the LLM's capacity to learn morphological variations from data, potentially augmented by lemmatization if necessary (though subword tokenization often mitigates this).
- **Code-Mixing:** Use language identification and transliteration tools (e.g., ai4bharat-transliteration) if significant English code-mixing is present in datasets.
- **Formatting:** Convert cleaned data into suitable formats (e.g., JSONL) for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), typically with "prompt" and "completion" fields or structured dialogue turns, ensuring consistent instruction formatting.

### 4.4 Fine-tuning with PEFT (LoRA/QLoRA)

We recommend LoRA/QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning:

- **Concept:** Freeze base model weights, inject trainable low-rank matrices (ΔW = BA) into specific layers (e.g., attention query/value matrices). QLoRA adds 4-bit quantization of the base model.
- **Implementation:** Utilize the Hugging Face `peft` library.

```python
# Example: Setting up QLoRA configuration with PEFT
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, prepare_model_for_kbit_training
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig
import torch # Ensure torch is imported for dtype

# Configuration for QLoRA (4-bit quantization)
quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4", # Recommended quantization type
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16, # Or torch.float16 depending on GPU
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True, # Optional for more memory saving
)

# Load the base Gemma 3 4B model
model_name = "google/gemma-3-4b-it" # Or the specific variant being used
# model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
#     model_name,
#     quantization_config=quantization_config, # Use this line for QLoRA
#     device_map="auto" # Helps distribute model across available GPUs/CPU RAM
# )
# print("Model loaded (quantized).") # Uncomment when running

# --- Placeholder for model loading ---
# print("Simulating model loading...")
# class DummyModel: # Replace with actual model loading
#     def __init__(self): self.model_parallel = False; self.is_parallelizable = True
#     def add_adapter(self, config): pass
#     def print_trainable_parameters(self): print("Trainable parameters simulation.")
#     def gradient_checkpointing_enable(self): print("Gradient checkpointing enabled simulation.")
# model = DummyModel()
# --- End Placeholder ---

# Prepare model for k-bit training (important for QLoRA)
# model.gradient_checkpointing_enable() # Optional: further reduces memory at cost of speed
# model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)
# print("Model prepared for k-bit training.") # Uncomment when running

# Define LoRA configuration
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,  # Rank of the low-rank matrices (typical values: 8, 16, 32, 64)
    lora_alpha=32, # Scaling factor (often 2*r)
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj", "k_proj", "o_proj", "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj"], # Target linear layers common in models like Gemma/Llama
    lora_dropout=0.05, # Dropout probability for LoRA layers
    bias="none", # Whether to train biases ('none', 'all', or 'lora_only')
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM" # Specify task type
)
print("LoRA config defined.")

# Apply LoRA configuration to the prepared model
# peft_model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config) # Uncomment when model is loaded
# print("LoRA configured and applied to the model.")
# peft_model.print_trainable_parameters() # Verify the small number of trainable params
```

- **QLoRA:** Recommended for significantly reducing memory usage, allowing fine-tuning on GPUs with less VRAM (e.g., 16GB or potentially even less). Requires the `bitsandbytes` library.

### 4.5 Training Frameworks & Documentation

Several frameworks can facilitate the fine-tuning process. Utilizing their documentation is key:

- **Hugging Face (transformers + peft + trl):** Recommended primary choice.
    - `transformers`: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index
    - `peft`: https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index
    - `trl` (SFTTrainer): https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index
- **PyTorch Lightning:** Offers structure and scalability.
    - Documentation: https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/
- **Keras 3:** User-friendly API with multi-backend support.
    - Guides: https://keras.io/guides/

    - GitHub/Documentation: https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth
- **Gemma Library for JAX:** Optimal for TPUs.
    - GitHub/Documentation: https://github.com/google/gemma

### 4.6 Concrete Task Mix and Training Strategy

- **Dataset Composition:** Prepare a combined fine-tuning dataset by sampling from the curated sources. A suggested starting mix:
    - **50% Conversational Data:** Prioritize multi-turn dialogues and instruction-following data (e.g., ai4bharat/indic-align, FutureBeeAI, Macgence transcripts) to enhance interaction capabilities.
    - **30% General Text Data:** Include diverse text (e.g., IndicCorp, News articles) formatted as instruction-following tasks (e.g., "Continue this text:", "Explain this concept:") to improve fluency, grammar, and general knowledge in Gujarati.
    - **20% Summarization Data:** Use article/headline or article/summary pairs (e.g., XLSum, ILSUM) formatted as summarization instructions.
- **Rationale:** This mix prioritizes conversational ability while ensuring strong foundational language understanding and specific task competence (summarization). Proportions can be adjusted based on initial results and target application focus.

- **Training Methodology:**
    - **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):** Use the combined dataset formatted for instruction following.
    - **Framework:** Employ Hugging Face `trl`'s SFTTrainer for simplified training loop management with PEFT.
    - **Key Hyperparameters (Initial Suggestions):**
        - **Learning Rate:** 2e-5 to 5e-5 (for LoRA/QLoRA)
        - **Optimizer:** AdamW (with standard betas)
        - **LR Scheduler:** Cosine decay with warmup (e.g., 10% of steps)
        - **Batch Size:** Maximize based on GPU VRAM (e.g., effective batch size of 32-128 using gradient accumulation).
        - **Epochs:** 1-3 (monitor validation loss closely for overfitting).
        - **Weight Decay:** 0.01
    - **Validation:** Use a held-out portion (e.g., 5-10%) of the combined dataset for monitoring validation loss during training and selecting the best checkpoint.
    - **Multi-Task Learning:** The mixed dataset inherently facilitates multi-task learning. No complex curriculum is initially planned, but could be introduced if certain tasks lag.

### 4.7 Tokenizer Evaluation Strategy

While the primary strategy is to use Gemma 3 4B's native SentencePiece tokenizer, validation is prudent:

- **Goal:** Confirm the tokenizer's efficiency and effectiveness for Gujarati text.
- **Metrics:**
    - **Subword Fertility:** Calculate the average number of tokens generated per word on a representative sample of Gujarati text (e.g., from IndicCorp). Lower fertility (closer to 1) is generally better but depends on morphology. Compare against expectations for agglutinative vs. isolating languages.
    - **Vocabulary Overlap:** Analyze the overlap between the tokenizer's vocabulary and a frequency-ranked list of words/subwords from a large Gujarati corpus. Identify potential gaps for common Gujarati terms.
    - **Token Length Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of token sequence lengths for typical Gujarati documents/prompts compared to English. Ensure sequences don't become excessively long, impacting context window usage.
    - **Reconstruction Fidelity:** Tokenize and then detokenize a diverse set of Gujarati sentences (including complex words, proper nouns, numbers) to ensure minimal information loss or distortion.
- **Process:** Perform these analyses on a held-out Gujarati text corpus before starting large-scale fine-tuning. If significant inefficiencies are found (e.g., extremely high fertility, poor representation of common words), reconsidering tokenizer strategy (e.g., adding tokens - complex) might be warranted, but this is unlikely given Gemma's multilingual design.

## 5. Evaluation and Benchmarking Plan

### 5.1 Evaluation Metrics

Assessing the fine-tuned model's performance requires a combination of automated metrics and human evaluation:

- **General Understanding:**
    - **Perplexity:** Intrinsic measure on held-out Gujarati text.
    - **Downstream Tasks:** Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall on classification/QA tasks.
- **Gujarati Conversation:**
    - **BLEU:** N-gram overlap (fluency).
    - **ROUGE (esp. ROUGE-L):** Longest common subsequence (relevance, content).
    - **Human Evaluation:** Naturalness, coherence, relevance, grammar, overall quality.
- **Gujarati Summarization:**
    - **ROUGE (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L):** Standard overlap metrics.
    - **Human Evaluation:** Informativeness, conciseness, fluency, factual consistency, grammar.

**LaTeX Snippet Example (ROUGE-L):**

The ROUGE-L metric, based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), is calculated as:

$$ R_{\text{LCS}} = \frac{\text{LCS}(X, Y)}{\text{length}(X)} $$
$$ P_{\text{LCS}} = \frac{\text{LCS}(X, Y)}{\text{length}(Y)} $$
$$ F_{\text{LCS}} = \frac{(1 + \beta^2) R_{\text{LCS}} P_{\text{LCS}}}{R_{\text{LCS}} + \beta^2 P_{\text{LCS}} } $$

Where $X$ is the reference summary, $Y$ is the generated summary, and $\beta$ is typically set to prioritize recall.

### 5.2 Benchmarking Strategy

Establish performance relative to baselines and on standardized tasks:

- **Baselines:**
    - **Zero-Shot Base Model:** Evaluate the original `google/gemma-3-4b-it` model on all benchmark tasks without fine-tuning.
    - **(Optional) Other Models:** Compare against other available Gujarati or multilingual models if applicable and feasible.
- **Benchmark Datasets/Tasks:**
    - **IndicGLUE:** Utilize relevant tasks available for Gujarati within the IndicGLUE benchmark suite (https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org/indicglue/). Examples: Sentiment Analysis (Product Reviews), Natural Language Inference (if available).
    - **Custom Held-Out Test Sets:** Create distinct test sets (not used in training/validation) for:
        - **Conversational Ability:** A set of diverse conversational prompts/scenarios.
        - **Summarization:** A set of articles with reference summaries (e.g., from XLSum-Gu test split).
        - **General Instruction Following:** A set of varied instructions covering reasoning, writing, extraction, etc.
    - **FLORES-200:** Use the Gujarati portion of the FLORES-200 dataset for evaluating translation capabilities (Eng->Guj, Guj->Eng) if relevant to project goals, even if not explicitly trained for translation.
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Implement a structured human evaluation process where native Gujarati speakers rate model outputs on dimensions like fluency, coherence, accuracy, helpfulness, and safety across different task types. Use a standardized rubric.

## 6. Estimated Training Time

(Estimates remain unchanged from v1.1, dependent on hardware, data size, etc.)

**Assumptions:** Dataset ~100k pairs, Single T4/A10G GPU, 1-3 Epochs, QLoRA/LoRA, Batch Size 16-64, Seq Len 512-1024.

**Estimation:**

- **T4 (QLoRA):** 5-20 hours per epoch.
- **A10G (LoRA):** 3-12 hours per epoch.

**Note:** Benchmarking required for precise timing. Unsloth or multi-GPU setups may reduce time.

## 7. Estimated Cost Analysis

(Estimates remain unchanged from v1.1, dependent on hardware, time, provider pricing.)

**Assumptions:** Based on training time estimates and example cloud pricing (T4: ~$0.35-$0.70/hr, A10G: ~$0.80-$1.50/hr).

**Estimation:** Single fine-tuning run: $5 - $25 (compute cost, highly variable). Storage costs are minimal.

**Note:** Spot instances can lower costs. Larger datasets/more epochs increase costs.

## 8. Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

- **Data Scarcity/Quality:**
    - **Mitigation:** Rigorous cleaning, data augmentation, synthetic data (carefully), prioritize high-quality sources.
- **Overfitting:**
    - **Mitigation:** Regularization, PEFT, monitor validation loss, early stopping, reduce LoRA rank if needed.
- **Generating Coherent/Grammatical Gujarati:**
    - **Mitigation:** High-quality diverse data, robust preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, human evaluation feedback loop.
- **Computational Cost & Time:**
    - **Mitigation:** PEFT (QLoRA), efficient frameworks (Unsloth), quantization, spot instances, optimize batch/sequence length, start small.
- **Catastrophic Forgetting:** Ensure fine-tuning doesn't degrade general capabilities learned during pre-training (less likely with PEFT but monitor via broad benchmarks).

## 9. Custom Dataset Creation (If Needed)

(Process remains unchanged from v1.1)

- **Collection:** Web scraping (ethical), manual collection.
- **Annotation:** Tools (brat, doccano), crowdsourcing (quality control).
- **Cleaning/Formatting:** Noise removal, normalization, structuring (JSONL).

## 10. Conclusion

Fine-tuning Google Gemma 3 4B presents a viable and highly promising path towards creating a powerful LLM specifically tailored for the Gujarati language. By leveraging the model's strong multilingual foundation, utilizing extensive publicly available datasets according to a defined task mix, implementing robust preprocessing and PEFT methods (LoRA/QLoRA), and following structured training, evaluation, and benchmarking plans, significant improvements in Gujarati understanding, conversation, and summarization can be achieved cost-effectively. The outlined deployment strategy provides a path to making this enhanced capability accessible. This initiative holds the potential to greatly enhance the accessibility and utility of advanced AI for the Gujarati-speaking community.

## 11. Deployment Plan
